# Fibonacci

This is a simple program which can be used to compare 
3 different implementations of Fibonacci algorithm in Java regarding
the computation time.
The three implementations are as follow:

1. Recursive Fibonacci
2. Tail recursive Fibonacci
3. Iterative Fibonacci

Results show that iterative one is the fastest and recursive one is the
slowest. Therefore recursion is not always the best.
